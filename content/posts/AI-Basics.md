## 1. Introduction to AI
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

---

## 2. Machine Learning (ML)
**Machine Learning** is a subset of AI where algorithms learn from data to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, etc.
- **Key Term:** Model Training

---

## 3. Deep Learning (DL)
**Deep Learning** is a type of ML involving neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep"). It excels in tasks like image and speech recognition.

- **Key Term:** Neural Network Layers, Backpropagation

---

## 4. Neural Networks
**Neural Networks** are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

- **Types:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

---

## 5. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
**NLP** focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language.

- **Applications:** Chatbots, Language Translation, Sentiment Analysis
- **Key Terms:** Tokenization, Lemmatization, BERT, GPT

---

## 6. Computer Vision (CV)
**Computer Vision** allows machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data like images or videos.

- **Applications:** Face Recognition, Object Detection
- **Key Terms:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Image Segmentation

---

## 7. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
**Reinforcement Learning** is a type of learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

- **Key Terms:** Agent, Reward, Policy, Q-Learning

---

## 8. Supervised Learning
**Supervised Learning** involves training a model on labeled data, meaning the input comes with corresponding outputs (labels).

- **Examples:** Classification, Regression
- **Key Terms:** Training Data, Test Data

---

## 9. Unsupervised Learning
**Unsupervised Learning** involves models learning patterns and structures from data without labeled outcomes.

- **Examples:** Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- **Key Terms:** K-Means, PCA

---

## 10. AI Ethics
**AI Ethics** addresses the moral challenges and societal impacts of AI technology, such as privacy, fairness, and accountability.

- **Key Topics:** Privacy, Autonomy, Responsible AI

---

## 11. AI Bias
**AI Bias** refers to systematic errors in AI models that lead to unfair outcomes based on race, gender, or other group attributes.

- **Key Terms:** Data Bias, Fairness

---

## 12. Explainability
**Explainability** is the concept of making AI models transparent, so humans can understand how decisions are made.

- **Key Terms:** Interpretability, Black-box Models

---

## 13. Edge AI
**Edge AI** involves deploying AI models locally on devices (like smartphones), reducing the need for constant communication with central servers.

- **Key Applications:** IoT, Real-time Processing

---

## 14. Federated Learning
**Federated Learning** allows AI models to be trained across multiple devices or servers while keeping the data decentralized and private.

- **Key Terms:** Privacy, Decentralization

---

## 15. Transfer Learning
**Transfer Learning** involves applying knowledge gained from one task to a different but related task, reducing the need for large datasets.

- **Key Applications:** Pretrained Models, Fine-Tuning
